              By J. Manuel Gonz√°lez. Mr. Gonzalez is not a Middle East Expert
              but offers alternative kinds of expertise that past and present
              Middle East experts apparently lack: an understanding of
              development economics, international finance, and creative
              business deal-making. For this essay he draws on a broad
              multi-cultural background working on four continents, many years
              of World Bank experience advising governments and corporations,
              and an out-of-the-box entrepreneurial mindset. For more

              <i>STATESPERSONS</i> advised by <i>EXPERTS</i> started the
              Palestine Problem over a hundred years ago. For 75 years
              <i>STATESPERSONS</i> and <i>EXPERTS</i> have tried to solve it,
              and have failed miserably. The manifold reasons for failure can be
              encapsulated in one thought: each side has measured the
              attractiveness of a deal not in terms of how much benefit they
              respectively got, but in terms of how much pain and inconvenience
              they could impose on the <i>other side</i>. They view the
              Palestine situation as a Zero-Sum Game.

              Now let an outsider point out the obvious Non-Zero-Sum Solution,
              that doesn't seem to have even been considered by the experts.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">But first, a little history.</p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              The Jewish people inhabited Palestine since before 1200 BCE.
              ("Palestine" is derived from "Philistines", who were probably
              Greek, unrelated to the Palestinian Arabs of today.) Following a
              failed revolt against the Roman Empire, by around 100 C.E. the
              Jews almost all abandoned the region but preserved their culture
              in widely-scattered communities.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              Around 1500, Palestine and adjacent regions, now occupied by
              Arabs, were subjugated by the Ottoman Empire. Then, during the
              First World War, the British promised various Arab factions, as
              well as the Palestinians, independence if they would support the
              Allies against the Ottomans.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              Those deals directly gave rise to most of the oil-rich Arab states
              or regimes of today, a point which we will return to later. In the
              case of the Palestinians, however, the British never intended to
              honor this promise. Under the 1922 Palestine Mandate after World
              War I, with financial backing by wealthy Jewish interests in the
              UK, they began a long-term project to bring in Jewish immigrants
              and eventually establish a separate Jewish state in Palestine.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              Almost exactly the same time in 1922, the British government was
              also busy figuring out how to give most of Ireland independence,
              while carving out six Pro-English counties to keep as Northern
              Ireland. This was their version of a "Two States Side-by-Side
              Solution." (Thence the cumbersome official name, "The United
              Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".) That led to 80
              years of guerrilla warfare in Ireland, mass incarcerations and
              executions, terrorist bombings, and political animosity up to
              today &#8212; thereby proving conclusively that whoever was in
              charge in Britain around 1922, they and their experts were very,
              very stupid.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              The movement for a Jewish homeland had arisen in the 19th Century
              and was called Zionism. It drew support from influential people
              and governments for reasons ranging from the sincere "Jews should
              have a homeland" to the strategic "Give the Arabs something to
              worry about", to the sneaky "We don't want them either, let's send
              them somewhere else".
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              The Arabs could see where this was heading &#8212; the
              dismemberment of Palestine. For 30 years after World War I the
              entire Arab world resisted the Zionist movement. But in 1947, with
              many countries feeling guilty or sorry about the Jewish Holocaust,
              Presto! Israel was born, and given roughly half the land area of
              Palestine.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              This was a Huge Injustice to the Palestinians, and (as proven by
              the past 75 years) a Very Grave Mistake from the viewpoint of
              world peace.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              The remaining Palestinian share of Palestine was casually
              gerrymandered in unconnected halves and quarters. Today,
              Palestinians are crowded into just the Gaza Strip (365 square
              kilometers), run by Hamas, an Iran-backed terrorist group not
              especially popular even among Palestinians; and the unconnected
              West Bank (5800 sqk), effectively run by Israel. Israel now has
              22,000 sqk, plus the West Bank plus about 1000 sqk in the Golan
              Heights, both seized in the 1967 Six-Day War and occupied ever
              since. (30,000 sqk total area for Palestine makes it about the
              size of Taiwan.) Flouting international law, Israel has encouraged
              settlement in both areas.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              On October 7, 2023 Hamas conducted a Raid that killed or took
              hostage almost 1500 innocent Israelis. This was horrifying and
              inexcusable. But the original dispossession of the Palestinians in
              1947-48 was also inexcusable, as is Israel's punitive war that has
              already destroyed over half of Gaza and killed some 40,000 people,
              mostly civilians. EVERYONE is at fault.

            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              Apparently unable to learn from history, most world leaders are
              seeking a truce based on the so-called Two-State Solution, the
              creation of an independent Palestinian nation within Palestine,
              side-by-side with Israel.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              Translation: Give the Palestinians yet another false promise.
              Slice up Palestine AGAIN, by convincing Israel to cede territory
              it currently controls, for the purpose of creating a hostile
              sovereign state right beside it.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              This is just a re-tread of past peace plans, which asked both
              sides to make major concessions against their self-interest. As a
              "plan", it hardly even merits the term, since no one can identify
              a piece of Palestine that the Israelis would be willing to give
              up, that an economically viable Palestinian nation could be built
              on. Gaza alone? ‚Äî a wasteland that no foreign lender or investor
              would support. Gaza and the West Bank? &#8212; ungovernable and in
              any case politically unlikely considering the half million Jews
              now occupying the West Bank.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              It should be obvious to anyone who can read maps or Benjamin
              Netanyahu's lips that, especially after the October 2023 Raid,
              Israel now perceives a need to control all of Palestine, "from the
              Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea." Curiously, Palestinians
              have exactly the same slogan.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              Israel might pause to negotiate for hostages or let world opinion
              cool down, but its long-term goal is crystal-clear, and that goal
              excludes the Two-State Solution as currently understood by world
              leaders.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              As for the Palestinians, there is no reasonable chunk of Palestine
              where they can have a self-sustaining economy. This was true in
              1947, and it is even more true today. Pre-Hamas-Raid, the
              Palestine economy consisted largely of foreign grants. Palestine
              has no mineral resources. There is practically no rainfall in the
              West Bank, and no way to impound rainfall in Gaza, whose coastal
              aquifer is badly deteriorated and polluted. That rules out
              agriculture. (By the way, for all its breast-beating about making
              the desert bloom, Israel only ekes out 1% of its GDP from
              agriculture.)
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              Result? No matter how Palestine was re-sliced territorially, a
              large part of a supposed sovereign Palestine's population would
              wind up unemployed or performing menial jobs for next-door Israel.
              The state would be "independent" but substantially dependent on
              continuous foreign aid and an inferior-client relationship with
              Israel.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              Sovereignty without self-respect is a sham.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              It should also be obvious that with some 40,000 Palestinians
              killed and about 100,000 more injured or permanently maimed in the
              Israeli military response since October 7, a larger corps of
              Israel-haters is inevitably arising. Do we think Israel doesn't

              tangible reasons than mutual hatred and Jewish strategic
              preferences. Palestine is topographically an unpromising candidate
              for political subdivision. Though it slopes down toward the Dead
              Sea, the region consists of mostly flattish desert with no forest
              cover, and has no internal natural boundaries or military
              choke-points that could justify or define a secure, defensible
              territory carved out from within it.

              Once the Very Grave Mistake of dispossessing the Palestinians in
              1947-48 was committed, the succeeding history has proven
              conclusively the foolishness of hoping that Palestinians and
              Israelis could happily share adjacent territory. Yet this is the
              "Solution" being flogged by countries such as the US, Russia, the

              Obviously there are enormous financial, logistical, and emotional
              hurdles in moving large numbers of people and building a New
              Palestine somewhere else. But this would still be more feasible
              than building a new Palestinian state amidst the rubble ( &#8212;
              who would provide funds for that proposition?), while 2 million
              Palestinians (if they are lucky) live in tent cities in Gaza for
              decades into the foreseeable future, and 3 million other
              Palestinians live in the increasingly-contentious West Bank. All
              would remain under constant threat from not just Israel but also
              Iran-funded Hamas, whose aim is not to serve the Palestinian
              people, but to keep making trouble.

            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              Here are some of the relevant considerations for a
              Two-States-Far-Apart Solution:
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              1. Whatever practical problems are foreseen with a New Palestine
              Somewhere Else, the same or worse problems apply to a Palestine
              Rebuilt Amidst the Rubble.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              2. Just as some people initially resist moving out of a
              hurricane's path, some Palestinians will not want to move. But
              that's okay.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              3. Fortunately, majority Palestinian agreement isn't required, any
              more than it was necessary that a majority of the world's Jews
              move to Israel in 1948, or that they even be consulted. Israel was
              a case of "If we build it, they will come", and so is New
              Palestine. A few hundred thousands are enough for an economically
              and politically viable state. Iceland has a reasonably
              self-sustaining economy with 350,000 people. Israel declared
              independence in 1948 with 850,000 Jewish inhabitants. Today, there
              may be enough Palestinians tired of war and willing to try
              something else. Others will follow eventually.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              4. No Peace Plan can come from or hinge on the US or anyone else
              in the West. Arab pride won't allow it.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              5. Therefore, the initiative and the wherewithal for a
              Two-States-But-Far-Apart Solution must come from the Arab world.
              Ideally, one country would step forward and take charge.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              6. Luckily, the oil-wealthy Arab states collectively have US$ 4
              Trillion in accumulated oil wealth, and a proven willingness to
              spend some of that wealth to enhance their prestige and influence.

            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              7. Various Arab-ethnic countries have land they don't use or at
              any rate could easily spare.

              Unlike previous Peace Plans from Kissinger to Kushner, the
              Two-States-But-Far-Apart Plan does not ask various parties to make
              major concessions against their self-interest, but instead
              maximizes everyone's benefit, while limiting or at least isolating
              each party's perceived costs and concessions.

            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              The "Art of the Deal" does not, as certain theorists believe,
              consist of extracting maximum concessions from the other side. It
              consists of identifying the benefits that your side values most,
              and finding how to achieve those objectives through concessions
              that the other side values least.

              with Hope for the Future.

            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              What do most of the Arab countries want? They want to put a
              permanent end to the Palestine Problem and the
              now-75-years-running War before it jeopardizes their economic
              interests; they want to derail Iran's ambition to lead the Islamic
              world; and they want to enhance their stature on the world stage.

              Finally, what do the US and the other Western Powers want? This is
              more complex, but they are all finding that while officially their
              countries are aligned with Israel, large portions of their
              electorates sympathize with the Palestinians in Gaza and believe
              Israel's War immoral or even genocidal. Vietnam War protests
              toppled a US President. Worsening Palestine War protests could
              topple administrations from Washington to Warsaw. Therefore the
              Western Powers need a quick end to the War, not just any truce,
              but a long-term solution that gives all sides a clear win, and
              that satisfies pro-Israel as well as pro-Palestinian voters.

              Arabia's Red Sea coastline is 1800 kilometers long; a 200
              kilometer (coastline) x 50 kilometer (inland) parcel would hardly
              be noticed. (Gaza's coastline is 40 km; the West Bank is
              landlocked, and the Jordan River is just a stream in a long
              gully.) 5 million Palestinians into 10,000 sqk gives 500/sqk

              10,000 sqk (1% of Egypt's area), then provide funds for

              Addressing internal dissenters, the wealthy Arab states could also
              recall that they owe their sovereignty and their oilfields to
              serendipitous decisions by the same countries that spawned the
              Palestine Problem. Call it Divine Providence. Had it not been for
              the British, Kuwait would have remained a minor Iraqi tribe.
              (Indeed, for several decades before it found oil, Kuwait waged a
              rebellion to rejoin Iraq, which was already oil-rich, rather than
              remain a British protectorate.) And had it not been for the
              Americans, Saddam Hussein would have made it a minor tribe again,
              then swallowed the emirates and the Saudi oilfields on the Arabian
              Gulf (meaning all of them), and he wouldn't have stopped until he
              got to Djibouti. Repaying 5% to remain in the good graces of

              Egypt's northern Sinai cannot be the site for New Palestine. It
              adjoins Israel. No one seems to have understood this, either. A
              more plausible location would be southwestern Sinai, separated
              from both Israel and Egypt by empty desert plus mountains, and
              little use to Egypt as a country. How about a mixed

              same GDP/capita as Egypt; a respected UK-educated monarch in
              charge; and a Crown Prince married to a Saudi with royal

              essentially unoccupied; the biggest town has a population of
              15,000. The entire protrusion was allocated to then Transjordan in
              1921-22 solely so an Iraqi-oil pipeline could run to the
              Mediterranean over British-controlled territory. This pipeline was
              closed in 1948, so the protrusion's rationale has long been moot,

              technologies for cost-efficient extraction of water from air with
              as little as 30% humidity (Jordan's typical humidity is 30-40%).
              The region has pleasant sub-tropical temperatures (like
              Darjeeling), and better protection from sea-level rise (600+
              meters elevation v. Gaza's 14). With intelligent
              environmentally-aware development, an idyllic 10,000 sqk New

              be established, some of these refugees could be relocated, easing

              Millions already left after past wars, and many more would follow,
              if they had somewhere to go. An immediate majority isn't even
              needed. In 1948 Israel had 850,000 Jewish inhabitants. It was a
              case of "If we build it, they will come." So is New Palestine.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              <b>Why evict the Palestinians and not the Jews?</b> This is not an
              eviction, but an incentive. There is no imaginable inducement
              which would persuade Israelis to move, while a sovereign New
              Palestine in a decent location would certainly attract many
              Palestinians. We can keep nurturing a grudge, however legitimate,
              forever arguing over blighted terrain with very poor prospects for
              future security and prosperity. Or we can move on.

              <b>The oil-rich states won't contribute.</b> If they carefully
              consider the broader situation, they will. In the Palestine
              context, the Arab states have postured as "victims of Israeli
              aggression and foreign meddling". Here is a chance to show the
              world that they can take assertive, meaningful action and be
              heroes instead of victims. US$200 Billion is cheap, less than
              Qatar spent to host the 2022 FIFA games. The ongoing War and
              attempts to mitigate the Palestinians' plight are also costing
              money that would be better spent building New Palestine Somewhere
              Else. Finally, if the wealthy Arab states don't spend it now, it
              will cost them more later through Iran's ascendancy. And it will
              cost the entire world much, much more, if Iranian-style extremism
              becomes the norm in Nigeria, Turkey, Pakistan, Malaysia,
              Indonesia, Bangladesh, and eventually the Arab countries
              themselves.

              Never mind what this issue even is. It is a red herring and a
              deliberate roadblock, like agreeing to your friend's choice of
              movie only if you can also get a date with the lead actor. The
              people who raise this "requirement" are those showing off how much
              they know, or who don't want a meaningful solution at all. Most of
              them are not starving in Gaza, but well-fed and free to
              pontificate from the safety and comfort of Teheran or Berlin.

              Neither does it cure cancer. But it will certainly avert more
              deaths than continued warfare or an imposed Two States
              Side-by-Side. Hamas's leaders will be more amenable to releasing
              hostages as they lose popular support from the Palestinians once a
              unilateral ceasefire is declared, humanitarian aid starts flowing,
              and the prospect of a real long-term solution is evident.

              <b>Israel still won't agree.</b> So far Israel not been offered
              anything valuable in exchange for a ceasefire. Given a clear
              chance to achieve its security goals and indeed all its legitimate
              goals, it would have to agree, or the world would rightly condemn
              its War as genocidal rather than defensive in intent.

            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0">
              <b>Hamas won't agree.</b> Their agreement isn't needed. We can
              hope that most members of Hamas are rational and will consider
              that New Palestine represents "Mission Accomplished" for them. The
              irrational elements could still cause disruption with ambushes or
              suicide bombings, but that risk exists anywhere in the world,
              regardless of what is supposedly agreed, and would be much higher
              in an imposed Two States Side-by-Side outcome. Two States Far
              Apart offers &#8212; by far &#8212; the lesser risk of continued
              terrorism or harm to hostages.

              <b>Building a country from scratch is impossible.</b> Whatever
              problems are foreseen for a New Palestine Somewhere Else, they are
              worse for Rebuilding Palestine Amidst the Rubble. China has
              routinely built cities for tens of millions in the last decades.
              So could the US, Japan, and the EU if they were so inclined. The
              world's best and brightest in their fields, from constitutional
              law to scientific research to engineering and modular
              construction, wouldn't support a hopeless cause in Gaza, but might
              contribute their energy and genius to New Palestine, so long as it
              is &#8212; Somewhere Else.

              As of June, 2025, the Gaza War has now dragged on for almost two
              years. Palestinians are dying daily from bombings, lack of medical
              care, and outright famine. As predicted in past releases of this
              White Paper, the world is creeping closer to a broader conflict
              that will upturn the world order. The recent front opened against
              Iran further complicates matters, by splitting the sympathies of
              the rest of the Islamic World.

              The rest of the world is apt to forget that Iranian civilization
              is 6000 years old and proud of it, compared with a few hundred
              years or less for any other power in the area. If the Iranian
              fundamentalist regime survives, fundamentalism will spread to
              other countries. If it develops even one low-yield nuclear bomb,
              then it is only a matter of time before they use it, lest it be
              destroyed in a future US or Israeli strike. If the current regime
              does not survive, the power vacuum will be filled in unpredictable
              ways.
